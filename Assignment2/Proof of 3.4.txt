Exercise 3.4

Prove that the vector w is orthogonal to the line (3.18). (Hint: Use a geometric argument.)

——————————————————————————————————————————————

Given: 
  - The definition of orthogonal is given in Definition 3.9. To be orthogonal, two vectors must be 0-length and their cross product must be 0.
  - Vector w is a normal vector.
  - Vector x is a position vector.
  - The normal w cross product x was shown to be 0. This is because the cosine of the angle between them is 0.

Left to be shown:
  - w cross product x equals b is also equal to 0.

Strategy:
  - w and x are non-zero length. 
  - Show that the translation from mx + y = 0 to mx + y = b does not change the angle between them.


Page 37 of the text states that translation does not change orientation. So, the angle must be constant. However, I’m having a hard time proving mathematically that the angle remains constant.
