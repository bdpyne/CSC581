The screen shot shows the decision surface point. Combining it with the origin, you can get the decision surface plotted.
Plotting the training data set points is trivial - plot(training.set) assuming training.set <- read.csv("trainingset.csv").
However, I haven't figured out how to put a line in the graph. I'll figure it out before the next assignment. Use of the
lattice library might help.

I have most of Algorithm 5.1 worked out in the PAlgo.R file. The plan is to work it out then merge it into the Perceptron.R file.
Perceptron.R is just boilerplate.
